      <description>Making my own portfolio/blog websiteI made a portfolio website using React, it looks like this:
I wanted to have card-based content (i.e., grids of boxes) and the ability to navigate to different categories of portfolio items, rather than just list all items on the same page. I also wanted it to look fun, and have some kind of animation. You canâ€™t see the animation in the screenshot, but I made the folders spin around and open and close.</description>
