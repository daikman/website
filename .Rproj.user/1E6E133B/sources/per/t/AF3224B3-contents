I'll soon complete my MSc in Psychological Research Methods (at the University of Glasgow), after which I hope to pursue a PhD in something related to mental health, computational modeling, artificial intelligence, or all three. Additionally, since reading Invisible Women, I've become motivated to learn more about machine learning bias and the 'gender data gap'.

My Bachelors and Masters research projects are psychometrics-focussed, using techniques like Structural Equation Modeling to investigate the belief in free will, other similar constructs (e.g., Locus of Control), and Subjective Well-being.

I made the animation above using `gganimate`, a package for `R`, which is the first programming (or scripting?) language I learned. It it still my favourite but I have branched out into other languages recently - I am enjoying producing graphics and animations using JavaScript, for example (see my Belief Polarization post).
