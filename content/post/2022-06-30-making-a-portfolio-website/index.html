<h1>Making my own portfolio/blog website</h1>
<p>I made a portfolio website using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/portfolio-screenshot.PNG" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>I wanted to have card-based content (i.e., grids of boxes) and the ability to navigate to different categories of portfolio items, rather than just list all items on the same page. I also wanted it to look fun, and have some kind of animation. You canâ€™t see the animation in the screenshot, but I made the folders spin around and open and close.</p>

<h2>Quirks</h2>
<p>There are a couple of interesting details about this project. One is the use of <a href="https://zzz.dog/">Zdog</a> to create the 3D folder models/animations. I found this pretty fun, but I am not entirely happy with how the animations are controlled within the React framework (I used <code>useEffect</code> to update the model parameters at a specific interval).
Another thing I had to do was change the standard <code>create-react-app</code> project in order to facilitate hosting with GitHub pages. I needed change the name of the build folder, and use <code>HashRouter</code> rather than <code>BrowserRouter</code> (due to their being no server interactivity).</p>
<p>To change the name of the build folder, I created a file called <code>.env</code> in the root directory and added this line:</p>
<pre><code>BUILD_PATH = &quot;docs&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To use the <code>HashRouter</code> I used the following line at the top of the component that uses a Router:</p>
<pre class="js"><code>import { HashRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from &#39;react-router-dom&#39;</code></pre>
<script type="text/javascript">
import { HashRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'
</script>

<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>The main thing I learned while making this website was how to use build tools in web development. I had previously only used plain JavaScript, HTML and CSS to develop for the web. I think React mostly quite intuitive, although I found the standard <code>npx create-react-app</code> to be pretty bloated for a beginner.</p>
