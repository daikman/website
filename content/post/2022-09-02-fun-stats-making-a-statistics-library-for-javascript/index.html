<p>I recently made a JavaScript library for fundamental statistics (fun-stats).</p>
<p>It was fun! I learned how to use <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup.js</a> for bundling
code, and how to publish packages to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fun-stats">npm</a>. I also learned a lot about the mathematics behind the statistics I have been applying for years, which is a hole in my knowledge I have been wanting to fill for a while.</p>

<p>You can see the documentation for this package <a href="https://daikman.github.io/fun-stats">here</a>. It has functions for calculating a plotting a few probability distributions. If you use it, that would be cool.</p>
