I recently made a JavaScript library for fundamental statistics (fun-stats).

It was fun! I learned how to use [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) for bundling 
code, and how to publish packages to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fun-stats). I also learned a lot about the mathematics behind the statistics I have been applying for years, which is a hole in my knowledge I have been wanting to fill for a while.

You can see the documentation for this package [here](https://daikman.github.io/fun-stats). It has functions for calculating a plotting a few probability distributions. If you use it, that would be cool.
