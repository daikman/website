Hello! I'm David :)

Right now (August 2021) I'm Data Scientist at [Public Health Scotland](https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/). I build infrastructure for the automation of the processing and publishing of data. I also lead the Open Data project.

I used to be a researcher at [Emerald Works](https://emeraldworks.com) (which has been rebranded as "Mind Tools for Business"), where I did things like data analysis using, writing and designing interactive research reports using `D3.js`, and assisting with the development of a product (a benchmarking tool) with an agile team.

Before that, I was at the University of Glasgow studying for a BSc and an MSc. My research projects concerned psychometrics (measuring psychological things like personality) and experimental design.

If you want to contact me, you can @/DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/researchingdave) and my personal email is: [davidjaikman@outlook.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email).

See ya!
